## Overview
This Number Recognition Program is a machine learning project that I developed as university 
student as part of a learning journey in understanding neural networks and their applications. 
The program uses a simple neural network to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) and aims to 
showcase the foundational principles of neural network architecture, training, and inference.

## Features
- **Digit Classification:** Recognizes handwritten numbers from 0 to 9.
- **Neural Network Model:** A custom-built neural network architecture tailored for image-based classification.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Allows training on datasets, as well as real-time testing with user-provided images.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Enables fine-tuning of the model using images captured during testing to improve recognition accuracy on specific inputs.
- **Model Exploration:** Experiment with different network configurations, learning rates, and epochs to observe how each parameter affects the model's performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The main programming language for the project.
- **TensorFlow:** For building, training, and deploying the neural network.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib:** For visualizing data and model performance.
- **Tkinter:** For creating a graphical interface to interact with the program.
- **Pillow:** For handling image operations, such as capturing and processing user-drawn input.
- **JSON:** For configuration and data storage management.
