**Expressify** captures a live webcam frame, analyses the facial emotion with a fine-tuned FaceNet model, extracts sentiment from the user’s typed text, and flags any mismatch in real time.  

## Why it matters 🚩

Domestic-abuse survivors, tele-therapy clients, and remote workers often mask genuine affect. Expressify surfaces subtle discord between **what you say** and **how you look**, giving counsellors or safeguarding staff an early-warning signal—without sending any sensitive data to the cloud.

## Tech stack & skills demonstrated 🛠️

| Layer | Tech | Highlights |
|-------|------|------------|
| Vision | PyTorch · facenet-pytorch | End-to-end fine-tuned Inception-ResNet-V1 (75 % accuracy on AffectNet) |
| NLP | HuggingFace Transformers | DistilBERT sentiment classifier, zero-shot on 7 emotions |
| GUI | Tkinter | &lt; 40 ms webcam-to-prediction latency on RTX 3070 |
| DataOps | Kaggle API · OpenCV | One-command download → crop → manifest pipeline |
| MLOps | Conda · Docker · TensorBoard | Fully reproducible runs with `torch.manual_seed(42)` |

## Quick-start 🚀

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahmet-Toplu/emotion_recognition.git
cd emotion_recognition
conda env create -f environment.yml && conda activate expressify
python app/gui.py          # launches the desktop app
```

## Benchmarks 📊
Dataset             Accuracy                Macro F1
AffectNet val       0.757                   0.756
FER-2013 val        0.642                   0.635
Pilot webcam study  0.71 (happy/surprise)

## Limitations & roadmap 🔭
	•	Still confuses fear ↔ surprise and sad ↔ neutral; exploring co-attention fusion.
	•	GUI is macOS/Linux-only today; Windows support and Electron wrap are planned.
	•	SpiralConv2D prototype archived in experiments/—conceptual but non-functional.
